# EchEmu
An attempt to create a decent NES emulator

## Note
Got busy with life and now I don't plan to work on it anymore. I so much wish I could implement Konami VRC7. I migh tcome back to it someday later tho

Update:- Implemented PPU with scrolling and some other stuffs. Can boot many NROM games fine and they're playable, kept aside some glithces

## Todo
1. Implement APU
2. Implement MMC1-5 and Konami VRC7 (and rest too maybe?)
3. Do performance improvements

## Controls 
WASD = D-Pad
K = A button
L = B button
V = Select
B = Start
