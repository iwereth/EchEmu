# NESemu
An attempt to create a highly accurate NES emulator. There are indeed many around already but it seems fun so I decided to make one! 

Update:- Implemented PPU. Works fine to boot and work for simple games without scroll and trickery. Not implemented controller, will be the next

Code is messy as of now, as I made lot of changes on the way as I code (I am novice :> ), but I will try to make it more readable and understandable soon!!!
